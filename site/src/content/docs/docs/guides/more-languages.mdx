description: Guides for Hex, Pub, Swift, CocoaPods, CRAN, SBT, and Conda package formats
---

Artifact Keeper supports additional package formats beyond the most common ones. This guide covers configuration and usage for Hex, Pub, Swift, CocoaPods, CRAN, SBT, and Conda.

## Hex (Elixir / Erlang)

Hex is the package manager for the Erlang ecosystem, used by Elixir and Erlang projects.

### Endpoint Information

- **Repository Type Key**: `hex`
- **API Endpoint**: `/hex/{repo}`
- **Clients**: `mix`, `rebar3`

### Client Configuration

Configure the `HEX_MIRROR` environment variable to point to your Artifact Keeper instance:

```bash
export HEX_MIRROR=https://artifact-keeper.example.com/hex/my-repo
```

For Mix projects, you can also configure the mirror in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:my_package, "~> 1.0", organization: "my-repo"}
  ]
end
```

### Publishing Packages

Publish packages using `mix hex.publish`:

```bash
# Build and publish
mix hex.build
mix hex.publish --organization my-repo
```

### Installing Packages

Install packages using Mix:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Or with rebar3:

```bash
rebar3 get-deps
```

## Pub (Dart / Flutter)

Pub is the package manager for Dart and Flutter applications.

### Endpoint Information

### Client Configuration

Configure the `PUB_HOSTED_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://artifact-keeper.example.com/pub/my-repo
```

Or configure it in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_package:
    hosted:
      url: https://artifact-keeper.example.com/pub/my-repo
    version: ^1.0.0
```

### Publishing Packages

Publish packages using `dart pub publish` or `flutter pub publish`:

```bash
# Dry run
dart pub publish --dry-run

# Publish
dart pub publish --server https://artifact-keeper.example.com/pub/my-repo
```

### Installing Packages

Install packages using pub:

```bash
# Dart
dart pub get

# Flutter
flutter pub get
```

## Swift

Swift Package Manager is the official package manager for Swift and Apple ecosystem projects.

### Endpoint Information

- **Repository Type Key**: `swift`
- **API Endpoint**: `/swift/{repo}`
- **Clients**: Swift Package Manager

### Client Configuration

Configure package dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/swift/my-repo/MyDependency",
            from: "1.0.0"
        )
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyPackage",
            dependencies: ["MyDependency"]
        )
    ]
)
```

### Publishing Packages

Swift packages are typically published via Git tags. Configure your repository URL to point to Artifact Keeper:

```bash
# Tag and push to Artifact Keeper
git tag 1.0.0
git push https://artifact-keeper.example.com/swift/my-repo/MyPackage --tags
```

### Resolving Packages

Resolve and update packages:

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

### Endpoint Information

- **Repository Type Key**: `cocoapods`
- **API Endpoint**: `/cocoapods/{repo}`
- **Clients**: `pod`

### Client Configuration

Configure your `Podfile` to use Artifact Keeper as a source:

```ruby
source 'https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cocoapods/my-repo'
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'  # Fallback to public CocoaPods

platform :ios, '14.0'

target 'MyApp' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'MyPrivatePod', '~> 1.0'
  pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.0'  # Public pod from CocoaPods
end
```

### Publishing Pods

Publish a pod to your private repository:

```bash
# Validate podspec
pod spec lint MyPod.podspec

# Push to Artifact Keeper
pod repo add my-repo https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cocoapods/my-repo
pod repo push my-repo MyPod.podspec
```

### Installing Pods

Install dependencies:

```bash
pod install
pod update
```

---

## CRAN (R)

CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) format for R packages.

### Endpoint Information

- **Repository Type Key**: `cran`
- **API Endpoint**: `/cran/{repo}`
- **Clients**: `R`, `install.packages`

### Client Configuration

Configure R to use Artifact Keeper as a repository:

```r
# In R console or .Rprofile
options(repos = c(
  my_repo = "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cran/my-repo",
  CRAN = "https://cran.r-project.org"
))
```

Or set it per-session:

```r
# Single session
repos <- c(
  "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cran/my-repo",
  "https://cran.r-project.org"
)
```

### Publishing Packages

Build and publish R packages:

```bash
# Build package
R CMD build my-package

# Submit to Artifact Keeper (via API or web interface)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -F "file=@my-package_1.0.0.tar.gz" \
  https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cran/my-repo/upload
```

### Installing Packages

Install packages from your repository:

```r
# Install from configured repository
install.packages("my-package")

# Install from specific repository
install.packages("my-package", repos = "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/cran/my-repo")
```

## SBT (Scala / JVM)

SBT (Scala Build Tool) uses Ivy repository format for Scala and JVM projects.

### Endpoint Information

- **Repository Type Key**: `sbt`
- **API Endpoint**: `/ivy/{repo}`
- **Clients**: `sbt`, Ivy

### Client Configuration

Configure `build.sbt` to use Artifact Keeper as a resolver:

ThisBuild / organization := "com.example"
ThisBuild / version := "1.0.0"
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.3.1"

resolvers ++= Seq(
  "Artifact Keeper" at "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/ivy/my-repo",
  Resolver.defaultLocal
)

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.example" %% "my-library" % "1.0.0"
)
```

For publishing, configure credentials in `~/.sbt/1.0/credentials.sbt`:

```scala
credentials += Credentials(
  "Artifact Keeper",
  "artifact-keeper.example.com",
  "username",
  "token"
)
```

### Publishing Artifacts

Publish your library:

```scala
// In build.sbt, add publishing configuration
publishTo := Some(
  "Artifact Keeper" at "https://artifact-keeper.example.com/ivy/my-repo"
)

publishMavenStyle := false  // Use Ivy style
```

Then publish:

```bash
sbt publish
```
